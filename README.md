# About Me:
👋 Hey, I’m Hareem Khan! A Computer Science undergrad with a passion for cybersecurity, especially OSINT 🕵️‍♂️🔍. Currently diving into frontend development, I love building real-world solutions and bringing my imagination to life through code.

💡 I thrive on creative problem-solving—but LeetCode? Not my thing. 😤

Always up for new challenges and discussions, so let’s connect and make the digital world more secure! 🚀💻
