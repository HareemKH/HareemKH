# About Me:
👋 Hey, I’m Hareem Khan! A Computer Science undergrad with a passion for cybersecurity, especially OSINT 🕵️‍♂️🔍. Currently diving into frontend development, I love building real-world solutions and bringing my imagination to life through code.

💡 I thrive on creative problem-solving—but LeetCode? Not my thing. 😤

💡 Curious by nature and driven by learning, I firmly believe in trial and error—after all, if you can spend hours figuring something out, why take the shortcut of reading the instructions? :) 

🚀 I thrive on creative problem-solving, but when it comes to LeetCode? Let's just say it's not my preferred approach.
